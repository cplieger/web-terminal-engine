> Cross-language terminal emulator and session engine (Go) with browser renderer (TypeScript).

A standalone library that bridges a PTY to a browser WebSocket. The Go packages provide a VT100/VT500 screen buffer with SGR support and a WebSocket-based terminal session handler with reconnect, scrollback replay, and adaptive ping. The TypeScript package provides the browser-side renderer, keyboard mapper, mouse encoder, and binary wire decoder. No app-specific dependencies; only the standard library, `github.com/coder/websocket`, `github.com/creack/pty`, and `github.com/cplieger/runesafe`.

## Install

Go: `go get github.com/cplieger/web-terminal-engine/v3@latest` — TS: `npx jsr add @cplieger/web-terminal-engine` or `npm i @cplieger/web-terminal-engine`

## Usage

```go
import (
    "log/slog"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/cplieger/web-terminal-engine/v3/terminal"
)

h := terminal.NewHandler(
    []string{"/bin/bash"},
    terminal.WithWorkDir("/home/user"),
    terminal.WithLogger(slog.Default()),
)
mux := http.NewServeMux()
h.RegisterRoutes(mux)
// or use h as an http.Handler directly:
// mux.Handle("/ws", h)
```

```typescript
import { render, keyboard, mouse, decodeWireBinary } from "@cplieger/web-terminal-engine";

render.init({
  output: document.getElementById("term-output")!,
  termWrap: document.getElementById("term")!,
});
// On WebSocket binary message:
const msg = decodeWireBinary(event.data);
if (msg?.type === "screen") render.handleScreen(msg);
```

## API

### Go packages

- **`vt`** — VT100/VT500 screen buffer: `New(rows, cols)`, `Write([]byte)`, `Resize(rows, cols)`, `RenderRowWire(y)`, `DrainScrollback()`, `CursorPos()`, `HoldFlush()`, `ReleaseFlush()`, `IsFlushHeld()`, `RenderViewport()`, `RowString(y)`; one-shot event drains `TakeResponse()`, `TakeClipboard()`, `TakeBell()`, `TakeScrollbackCleared()`, `TakePaletteChanged()` (atomic take-and-clear — the pre-v3 public mutable fields with a read-then-clear convention are gone). Public fields: `Cells`, `Width`, `Height`, `Title`, `MouseMode`, `InAltScreen`, cursor/mode state.
- **`terminal`** — WebSocket session handler: `NewHandler(command, ...Option)`, `RegisterRoutes(mux)`, `ServeHTTP(w, r)`, `Shutdown()`. Options: `WithWorkDir`, `WithLogger`, `WithEnv`, `WithScrollbackCapacity`, `WithAcceptOptions`, `WithOnProcessExit`, `WithKeepUnfocused`, `WithTheme`. Handles PTY lifecycle, binary wire protocol, reconnect with scrollback replay, adaptive ping. `SessionManager` (`NewSessionManager`) fronts N PTY-backed sessions with `WebSocketHandler()` (`/ws?session=<id>`), `RESTHandler()` (`/api/sessions`), and `EventsHandler()` (SSE `/api/sessions/events`); status values working/idle/input/done/exited from a pluggable classifier. When several clients share one session, a live resize is last-writer-wins and the shared screen relaxes to the smallest remaining client's size on disconnect. `MountSessionRoutes(mux, ws, rest, events, ...MountOption)` wires the manager's documented route set — `WSPath` (`/ws`), `SessionsPath` (`/api/sessions`) + `SessionsSubtreePath` (both mounts), and `SessionEventsPath` (`/api/sessions/events`) — exactly and nothing else (the topology is a contract shared with the TS client's defaults; additions are release-noted API changes); `WithCreateGate(mw)` wraps the REST handler with a caller-supplied middleware so session creation (which forks a process per POST) can be rate-limited without the engine taking a middleware dependency; `(*SessionManager).MountAPI(mux, opts...)` is the one-manager convenience.

### TypeScript (`web/` — published as `@cplieger/web-terminal-engine` on NPM and JSR)

- **`render`** — DOM renderer driven by `ScreenMessage` / `ScrollMessage` frames: `init`, `handleScreen`, `handleScroll`, `updateFontMetrics`, `computeSize`, `getCursorPx`, `setPredictedCursor`, `resetScreen`, `resetScrollback`, `getHighestIndex`, `noteResumeBounds`, `updateReverseVideo`.
- **`keyboard`** — Translates `KeyboardEvent` to terminal byte sequences: `mapKeyboardEvent`, `bracketTextForPaste`, `prepareTextForTerminal`. Honors `applicationCursor`, `applicationKeypad`, `bracketedPaste`, and the kitty keyboard **disambiguate** flag (emits `CSI u` key events when the app enables the protocol).
- **`mouse`** — SGR 1006 mouse + focus reporting encoder: `init`, `encodeSGR`, `MouseInputHandler`.
- **`scroll`** — Auto-follow tracker for the scroll container: `init`, `stickToBottom`, `scrollToBottom`, `isUserScrolledUp`.
- **`modes`** — DEC private mode state (synced from server's `ModesMessage`): `setModes`, `isBracketedPaste`, `isApplicationCursor`, `getMouseMode`, `isMouseSGR`, `isFocusReporting`, `isApplicationKeypad`, `isReverseVideo`, `getKeyboardFlags`.
- **`decodeWireBinary(buf)`**: Top-level decoder for binary WebSocket frames; returns a `ServerMessage` or `null` for invalid/truncated frames.
- **Wire compatibility metadata**: `WIRE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_WIRE_VERSION`, `WIRE_INCOMPATIBLE_CLOSE_CODE`, and `WIRE_COMPATIBILITY` describe the TypeScript release's directional contract. The Go `terminal` package exposes the complementary `WireProtocolVersion`, `MinSupportedClientWireVersion`, and `WireIncompatibleCloseCode` constants.
- **`connection`**: Client → server WebSocket lifecycle, including socket ownership, exponential-backoff reconnect, and the resume/inputAck reliability layer (outbox + server-restart detection). Public methods are `init(callbacks)`, `connect`, `sendBinary`, `sendResize`, and `reconnectNow`; the `wsPath` callback option defaults to `"/ws"`. The module decodes frames and applies `modes.setModes` internally, so consumers only dispatch screen/scroll messages to `render`. It pairs with the Go `terminal` handler's resume protocol. `controlFrame` and `wsURL` are also exported for advanced use.
- **`connectStatusStream`** and the `SessionStatus` / `StatusStream` types: The SSE client for `/api/sessions/events` that drives per-tab status. `LineStore` and `CONTROL_FRAME_PREFIX` are also exported.
- **Wire types**: `WireRun`, `ScreenMessage`, `ScrollMessage`, `ModesMessage`, `TitleMessage`, `ResumeAckMessage`, `ServerMessage`, and `ControlMessage` are re-exported from the package root.

## Wire Protocol

The Go server and TypeScript client communicate over WebSocket frames rather than shared code. The authoritative byte-level definition is the code itself: the Go encoder (`terminal/wire_binary.go`), the Go `WireRun` types (`vt/wire.go`), and the TS decoder (`web/src/wire-binary.ts`). Round-trip fuzz tests and the `wire-golden/*.bin` fixtures keep those implementations aligned.

- **Binary and typed framing.** Server → client frames are binary messages with little-endian integers. Since wire v4, client → server control messages (resize, resume, ping) are text frames containing bare JSON, while binary frames carry raw terminal input with the full byte alphabet. Every socket first sends a v3-compatible `0x00`-prefixed binary resume and upgrades only after the resumeAck proves a v4 server. In the v3 framing, a solitary `[0x00]` and any `0x00`-leading frame that isn't a valid control message are delivered as terminal input; only `0x00` followed by valid control JSON uses the reserved control channel.
- **Absolute line indexing.** Every line receives a monotonic absolute index. Applying the same line is idempotent, resume aligns by index, eviction gaps are detectable, and a server epoch identifies restarts across reconnects. The exact index handling lives in `vt/wire.go`, `terminal/wire_binary.go`, and `web/src/wire-binary.ts`.
- **Compatibility revisions and directional floors.** The Go and TypeScript artifacts can be upgraded independently; package-version equality isn't required. Go exports `terminal.WireProtocolVersion` and `terminal.MinSupportedClientWireVersion`. TypeScript exports `WIRE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_WIRE_VERSION`, `WIRE_INCOMPATIBLE_CLOSE_CODE`, and `WIRE_COMPATIBILITY`. Both sides currently emit revision 4 and accept declared peers from revision 3. Version-silent peers remain supported. A declared revision below the receiver's floor is refused with close code 4002; a higher revision warns but continues because it may retain the compatible baseline. TypeScript consumers can surface these outcomes with `onWireVersionMismatch` and `onWireIncompatible`. A definitive incompatibility blocks automatic reconnects until `disconnect()` clears the terminal state, normally after the stale half is updated and the page reloads. Frozen previous-revision fixtures and the previous published decoder test both compatibility directions.

Client → server input for DEC modes (SGR 1006 mouse, focus reporting, application keypad) is encoded by the TS `mouse` / `keyboard` modules and consumed server-side by `vt`. For VT/DEC features intentionally absent from the wire, see [Unsupported by Design](#unsupported-by-design).

## Unsupported by Design

The following VT/DEC features are **intentionally not implemented**. Input bytes for these sequences are consumed (not echoed or half-rendered) and produce no visible effect, except where a row notes a performed side effect. This is a deliberate design choice — not a TODO.

> **Note on device queries:** several report/query sequences sharing the DCS or CSI parsers **are** supported for conformance. **DECRQSS** (`DCS $ q … ST`) answers SGR (`m`), scroll region (`r`), cursor style (`SP q`), protection (`" q`), conformance level (`" p`), left/right margins (`s`) and lines-per-page/screen (`t`, `* |`), replying `DCS 0 $ r ST` for anything else. **XTGETTCAP** (`DCS + q … ST`) answers the color-count capability (256). **DECRQCRA** (rectangular-area checksum) and **OSC 52** clipboard read-back are answered only when `Screen.AllowScreenReport` is enabled — both inject their reply into the PTY, so they default off. The VT model is validated against the [esctest2](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/esctest2) conformance suite (see CONTRIBUTING).
>
> **Note on the kitty keyboard protocol:** the [progressive-enhancement](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) negotiation **is** implemented — `CSI ? u` (query) is answered, and `CSI > u` / `CSI < u` / `CSI = u` (push / pop / set) manage per-screen flag stacks — so an app that queries for keyboard enhancement (e.g. crossterm/Codex) detects support. Only the **disambiguate** flag (`0x1`) is honored: the current flag is synced to the client, which then encodes unambiguous `CSI u` key events (Escape, Ctrl/Alt combinations, functional keys, and the keypad's `KP_*` navigation codes) while plain text still flows as text. The other flags — report-event-types (`0x2`), report-alternate-keys (`0x4`), report-all-keys (`0x8`), report-associated-text (`0x10`) — are masked off (`0x8`/`0x10` are incompatible with the browser's hidden-textarea/IME input model); the query reports only the honored flag, so an app that needs a masked-off one detects the gap and falls back. This is distinct from the kitty **image** protocol, which is unsupported (see the graphics row above).
