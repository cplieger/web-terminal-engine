//
// States 1 and 3 assert that an operation is under way, which contradicts both
// latches: "the turn finished" and "blocked, waiting on you" both say nothing is
// running. State 2 asserts a failure, an OUTCOME that must not stay masked by a
// stale success — a build that has since failed outranks an earlier "done".
//
// State 4 is the one that does not contradict either, and the specs are explicit
// about why: it is Windows' TBPF_PAUSED, "progress is currently stopped ... but
// can be resumed by the user. No error condition exists". That is not a rival
// claim to a needs-input latch, it is the SAME claim with less detail, and it is
// equally compatible with a finished turn, where nothing is progressing. Treating
// it as a rival (it was, by symmetry with state 2, until this was measured) hands
// the tab to the progress channel one sweep — 250ms — after the notification.
// kiro-cli makes that failure routine rather than theoretical: it sets state 4
// BECAUSE it is blocked on an approval, and parks state 4 at its context-usage
// percentage once idle, so the needs-input ring survived a quarter second of a
// minutes-long wait and the green done dot the same fraction of an idle period —
// the latter only above its 60% context threshold, which is what made the loss
// look intermittent. A latch this state cannot clear is not stuck: the moment the
