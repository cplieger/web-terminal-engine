// The session-manager HTTP surface's route topology. These paths are a
// CONTRACT shared with the engine's TypeScript client (the UI's tabs feature
// defaults to SessionsPath and its activity monitor to SessionEventsPath) and
// hardcoded inside RESTHandler's method patterns, so a consumer cannot mount
// the handlers anywhere else and keep a working client. MountSessionRoutes
// wires exactly this set; adding a path to it is a release-noted,
// changelog-visible API change, never a silent addition.

	// WSPath is the terminal WebSocket route. The client connects per session
	// with ?session=<id> (see WebSocketHandler).

	// SessionsPath is the exact-match session REST route: POST (create) and
	// GET (list). It is also the path a create gate throttles (see
	// WithCreateGate).
	SessionsPath = "/api/sessions"
	// SessionsSubtreePath is the session REST subtree: DELETE /{id} (close),
	// PUT /{id}/title (set the client-fallback title), PUT + DELETE
	// /{id}/pinned-title (set / clear the user's name), PUT /order (set the
	// shared display order every viewer sees) and GET + PUT /layout (read / set
	// the shared pane layout). ServeMux treats the trailing-slash pattern as a
	// distinct mount, so the REST handler is mounted at both SessionsPath and
	// this subtree to receive every method.
	//
	// /order and /layout are literal segments where their siblings take an
	// {id}. ServeMux prefers the more specific literal, and no session id can
	// collide with them (ids are hex), so the patterns cannot overlap.
	SessionsSubtreePath = "/api/sessions/"
	// SessionEventsPath is the session status stream (SSE) route. It is a more
	// specific pattern than SessionsSubtreePath, so ServeMux routes it to the
	// events handler rather than the REST DELETE /{id} pattern.

// The cache policy the session REST surface states, and the header it states it
// on. One spelling for the whole package so the wrapper below and writeJSON
// cannot drift apart into two different answers.
const (
	cacheControlHeader = "Cache-Control"
	noStorePolicy      = "no-store"
)

// withNoStore states the session REST surface's cache policy on the response
// header map BEFORE h runs. It is applied at two sites — inside RESTHandler
// (upstream of the inner mux) and in MountSessionRoutes (upstream of a create
// gate) — because neither alone covers everything; see MountSessionRoutes.
//
// What is at risk here is the cache KEY, not the body. Every session REST path
// past the collection carries a session id as a path segment, and that id IS the
// capability the /ws attach and resume present (the reason LogID exists and the
// reason writeJSON refuses to let the two JSON bodies be stored). The responses
// this wrapper newly covers carry no credential in their bodies at all — the
// inner mux's 404 and 405 are net/http's constant error text, a path-cleaning
// redirect is a Location header, a gate refusal is the consumer's throttle body.
// The exposure is that a cache retains an ENTRY keyed by a token-bearing URL,
// which RFC 9110 §15.1 invites by listing 404 and 405 among the statuses a cache
// may reuse heuristically when the response carries no explicit freshness
// information — and with no directive at all, those responses carried none.
//
// Setting the header here rather than in each handler settles the ordering
// requirement STRUCTURALLY: the value is in the map before any handler can call
// WriteHeader, after which a late Set is silently dropped and a wrapper that
// looks correct does nothing. This site cannot be missed either — it is upstream
// of every route in the mux, of every http.Error those routes reach, and of the
// responses the mux synthesizes for a path or method it does not serve, which no
// handler is invoked to write.
//
// A value already present is left exactly as it is. That is the deliberate
// escape hatch, and it is why the policy needs no opt-out MountOption: a
// consumer that wants a different answer — a stricter "no-store, no-cache,
// must-revalidate", or genuinely wanting one of these routes cached — says so by
// setting the header in its own outer middleware, which then stays that header's
// single writer. The package cannot rank a stricter value against a weaker one
// without parsing directives, so it treats any present value as intentional.
// writeJSON is the one deliberate exception and overwrites: its bodies
// CONTAIN the id, so their prohibition is not the consumer's to relax.

// is INJECTED rather than built in because throttle policy (tuning, the 429
// body, whether to gate at all) is the consumer's decision and the engine
// takes no HTTP-middleware dependency; pass a middleware that scopes itself to
// the create request — e.g. webhttp.SessionCreateRateLimit(SessionsPath),

// still answered requests — just each on the wrong route. Field names label
// each handler at the call site; normally the three are one SessionManager's
// WebSocketHandler / RESTHandler / EventsHandler, which MountAPI wires for you.
//
// Every field is required. The zero SessionHandlers is not usable: a nil
// handler reaches net/http's registration, which panics on "nil handler", so a
// partially-filled literal fails at mount time rather than serving a route
// that answers nothing.

// MountSessionRoutes wires the session-manager HTTP surface on mux — the

//	WSPath              -> h.WS     (terminal WebSocket, ?session=<id>)
//	SessionsPath        -> h.REST   (POST create, GET list; create-gated)
//	SessionsSubtreePath -> h.REST   (DELETE /{id}, PUT /{id}/title,
//	                                 PUT + DELETE /{id}/pinned-title,
//	                                 PUT /order, GET + PUT /layout;
//	                                 create-gated)

//
// Exactly these four mounts and no others: the engine's debug or future
// routes never appear implicitly, and any addition to the set is a
// release-noted API change (see the path constants). The handlers are passed
// in — normally WebSocketHandler, RESTHandler, and EventsHandler of one
// SessionManager, which MountAPI wires for you — so a consumer's tests can
// exercise routing and middleware with stubs, without a real PTY.
//
// The mount shape encodes two ServeMux subtleties consumers previously
// re-derived by hand: the REST handler needs BOTH the exact path and the
// subtree mount (its internal patterns span /api/sessions and
// /api/sessions/{id}...), and the SSE path, being more specific than the
// subtree, routes to events rather than the REST DELETE /{id} pattern.
//
// The REST mounts are wrapped in the surface's cache policy (withNoStore),
// outside any create gate, so every response on a token-bearing path states
// Cache-Control — including the ones no handler writes. WS and Events are not
// wrapped: one is a handshake, the other sets its own stricter value.

	// rather than by remembering an option; RESTHandler has already set the
