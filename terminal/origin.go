// OriginPolicy is the set of browser origins allowed to open a terminal
// WebSocket, in addition to the serving origin itself.
//
// It carries the whole cross-origin decision for this engine's sockets, because
// nothing above it can. A WebSocket handshake is a GET, and
// net/http.CrossOriginProtection — the CSRF middleware every consumer of this
// engine runs — returns early for GET, HEAD and OPTIONS as safe methods
// (csrf.go, Check). So an app-level cross-origin middleware never inspects the
// upgrade at all, and this policy plus the same-origin floor beneath it is the
// only gate between a hostile page and an interactive shell.
//
// A nil *OriginPolicy is valid and means same-origin only. That is the default
// and the safe direction, so a consumer that configures nothing is protected.
// The type is immutable once built and safe for concurrent use.

// NewOriginPolicy validates an operator-supplied origin allowlist and returns
// the policy plus the entries it dropped, so a caller can warn about a typo
// without failing startup (the drop-and-report shape webhttp's ParseHostList and
// ParseCIDRs use).
//
// Each entry must be a complete origin — scheme, host, optional port, and
// nothing else: "https://terminal.example.com", "http://localhost:7681",
// "https://[::1]:7681". The strictness is deliberate:
//
//   - A scheme is REQUIRED and must be http or https. "example.com" is not an
//     origin, and http://x and https://x are different origins that must not
//     collapse onto one entry.
//   - A path, query, fragment, or userinfo is refused. An origin has none of
//     them (RFC 6454), so such an entry could only ever be config that silently
//     matches nothing.
//   - "null" is refused, along with every other non-http(s) scheme. Browsers
//     send Origin: null for a sandboxed iframe and for a file:// page, so
//     allowing it would admit all of them at once.
//   - There are no wildcards. A pattern language buys one thing here (a whole
//     subdomain tree) and costs the "*" that quietly means allow-everything.
//
// A blank entry is skipped rather than reported, so a trailing comma in an env
// var is not an error. Matching is exact, on the origin lowercased and stripped
// of a default port.
//
// An all-invalid list yields an INACTIVE policy — same-origin only. That is the
// fail-closed direction for this type, and it is deliberately the opposite of
// webhttp's HostPolicy, where an all-invalid list becomes an active deny-all: a
// Host allowlist is a GATE, so an empty one must refuse everything, while an
// origin allowlist only ever WIDENS the same-origin floor, so an empty one must
// widen nothing.
