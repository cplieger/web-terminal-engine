// Session reaping is the engine's capability-free answer to the same problem
// containment solves with a cgroup: a PTY child can escape every signal-scoped
// boundary the engine otherwise has. A process that calls setsid() leaves both
// its process group and its session, so neither kill(-pgid) nor the PTY-close
// SIGHUP (delivered to the controlling terminal's FOREGROUND process group) can
// reach it, and a process re-parented to init has no ancestry left to walk.
//
// The boundary used here is an inherited environment marker. Every session's
// child is spawned with one unguessable variable, execve copies the environment
// into every descendant for free, and the marker survives exactly the two events
// that defeat the alternatives: setsid() does not clear the environment, and
// neither does re-parenting. So "every process belonging to this session" is a
// /proc scan, with no capability, no cgroup, no mount and no PID namespace.
//
// Measured on the container this was written for: a full scan of 17,547 pids
// costs ~81ms, the marker was inherited by every member of a tree whose KAS
// runtime had setsid()'d away, and a process-group kill reached 1 of the 2
// process groups the same tree spanned.
//
// Two honest limits, neither of which the alternatives improve on for free:
//
//   - A descendant that execve()s with a deliberately scrubbed environment
//     (env -i) escapes the domain. Nothing short of a cgroup or a PID namespace
//     catches that, which is why Containment still exists as the stronger,
//     opt-in boundary for hosts willing to grant it.
//   - The scan enumerates, so a tree that forks DURING teardown can outrun one
//     pass. The ladder below rescans before each escalation rather than reusing
//     the first pass's pid set, which bounds it to a fork racing the final
//     SIGKILL round.
//
// Reaping is unconditional: leaving a closed session's tree alive is the defect
// rather than a feature. (An opt-out shipped through v4 as WithoutSessionReap;
// it had no caller anywhere in the fleet and was removed at v5 — work meant to
// outlive a tab belongs outside the session's process tree, e.g. a detached
// service, not behind an engine knob.)

	// reapMarkerEnv names the variable every session's process tree inherits;

	// dropped because it is injected into the child's flat environment, where
	// the prefix disambiguates.
