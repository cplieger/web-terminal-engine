// Non-Linux stubs for the marker reap domain. The boundary is a /proc scan for
// an inherited environment variable, and no other platform exposes another
// process's environment through the filesystem, so the domain finds nothing and
// every step of the ladder degrades to a no-op.
//
// The marker is still injected into the child environment on these platforms:
// it is inert, costs one variable, and keeps the spawn path identical across
// builds rather than platform-forked at the one place a divergence would be
// hardest to test.
