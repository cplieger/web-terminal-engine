// scrollbackRing is a capacity-bounded ring buffer of scrollback lines,
// addressed by absolute line index.
//
// Every line that scrolls off the top of the VT screen is appended here
// and assigned a monotonic absolute index: the first line ever committed
// is index 0, the next is 1, and so on, growing without bound for the
// life of the session. The ring retains only the most recent `capacity`
// lines; older lines are evicted, but their indices are never reused. The
// absolute index of the current top screen row equals Committed().
//
// The buffer GROWS to `capacity` rather than being allocated at it, so a
// deep capacity costs a session nothing until it has actually produced that
// much history. This matters because capacity is an operator-set number
// (SCROLLBACK) whose whole point is that it can be set absurdly high:
// preallocating charged every session 24 bytes per configured line up front
// — 2.3 MB at the 100k default before a single line was printed, and 240 MB
// for an operator who asked for 10 million.
//
// Absolute indexing is the backbone of the engine. It makes resume
// alignment exact (the client asks for
// "everything after index H") and makes duplicate delivery structurally
// impossible (writing the same index twice overwrites the same row),
// replacing the old count-based scheme whose two independently-capped
// buffers drifted into overlaps and gaps.
