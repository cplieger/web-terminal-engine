// SessionManager runs N independent PTY-backed terminal sessions behind one set
// of HTTP handlers, so a browser can open several terminals (tabs) against one
// server. Each session is a *Handler (its own process, VT screen, scrollback,
// and resume state); sessions run continuously whether or not a client is
// attached. The manager owns creation, lookup, the crypto-random session id
// (which is both the routing id in /ws?session=<id> and the resume id), and an
// ownership-keyed idle reaper.
//
// Why N plain PTYs and not a terminal multiplexer: nesting under tmux would mean
// speaking tmux control mode to get per-session chrome, and a full-screen TUI
// under tmux collides on the prefix key and mouse/focus passthrough. dtach adds
// nothing here because the server process already outlives any client socket,
// which is the persistence we need.

// SessionID identifies one session: the value Create mints (128-bit
// crypto-random hex), the key /ws?session=<id> routes by, and the resume id. A
// distinct type rather than a bare string because a session id shares a
// parameter list with other strings on this surface (SetSessionTitle's title
// sits right next to it), and a swapped pair type-checks as plain strings while
// storing the id as a tab label. The type makes the ID position sticky, so a
// misplaced argument fails to compile.
//
// The type spans TWO populations, and the difference matters at every use:
//
//   - Ids this manager minted. Crypto-random hex, present in its maps.
//   - Ids a caller ASSERTS. A resume frame's controlMsg.SessionID and the
//     /ws?session= query value are arbitrary attacker-chosen bytes that arrive
//     already typed. THE TYPE IS NOT VALIDATION: converting a string to
//     SessionID checks nothing, and no constructor gates it.
//
// So a SessionID is only known to name a real session once a manager lookup
// says so — that lookup is the gate, not the type. Treat any id that has not
// been through one as untrusted text: bound it with LogID before it reaches a
// log, and never join it into a path (Containment.create sanitizes for exactly
// this reason). What the type buys is that the id cannot be transposed with a
// title, a path, a command or a cgroup prefix, which is a different and
// narrower claim than validity.
//
// On the wire an id is a plain JSON string: SessionID declares no MarshalJSON,
// so encoding/json emits a defined string type exactly as its underlying
// string, and omitempty elides it on empty as before.
