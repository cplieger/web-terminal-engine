// Package terminal bridges a PTY to a browser WebSocket.
//
// Each WS connection spawns the configured command in its own PTY and

// on reconnect the current cell snapshot is replayed to the new client.
// No external multiplexer is involved — the VT emulator IS the
// persistence layer.
//
// Wire protocol (binary WebSocket frames):
//
//	client → server: raw terminal input bytes
//	server → client: binary frames encoding screen/scroll/modes/title/
//	                 resumeAck/pong messages (see wire_binary.go) — PTY
//	                 output is rendered into the VT screen and sent as
//	                 absolute-indexed cell runs, not as raw bytes
//	client → server: JSON control messages prefixed with 0x00:
//	  {"type":"resize",...}, {"type":"resume",...}, {"type":"ping"}
//
// The 0x00 prefix byte distinguishes control messages from raw
// input; no valid terminal input starts with NUL.

//
//   - The socket's writeMu is acquired BLOCKING: a resume batch in flight
//     delays this sequence rather than dropping it, because the frame's
//     payloads are not regenerable — buildFrame has already committed its
//     scrollLines to the ring and consumed the one-shots (scrollbackCleared,
//     clipboard, bell), so a skipped frame would be a permanent scrollback
//     hole for the resuming client (its post-batch haveThrough jumps past
//     the missing lines, and resume replays only above haveThrough). The
//     cost is bounded: the batch's own writes run under a 10s budget, a
//     healthy batch is milliseconds, and only the resuming client's
//     goroutine waits — but the pass's wg.Wait does inherit that bound on
//     top of its own 5s write budget (the pre-existing wedged-client
//     exposure, same class, larger constant; see dispatchFrame's comment).
//
//   - A frame whose resume generation no longer matches was built BEFORE
//     the batch's screen snapshot, so its STATE payloads (screen, modes,
//     title) are dropped: writing them after the batch would regress the
//     client to pre-snapshot state the batch already superseded. Its
//     DURABLE payloads (scroll chunks, clipboard) are still written,
//     because the batch does not re-deliver them: the frame's scroll lines
//     sit at or below the snapshot's committed index while the resuming
//     client's haveThrough — its own window bottom — already spans their
//     indices, so the batch's LinesFrom(haveThrough+1) replay starts PAST
//     them (and under ring-cap pressure they may already be evicted from
//     the ring entirely); dropping them would be a permanent scrollback
//     hole. The clipboard payload is a consumed one-shot (OSC 52) no later
//     frame will carry again. Writing scroll after the batch is safe:
//     chunks carry absolute indices and the client applies them
//     idempotently. Two residuals, accepted and bounded:
//
//     1. The client's alt gate now accepts
//     history strictly below its frozen main win.base (store.ts
//     applyScroll), so a client the batch flipped into alt STORES the
//     durable chunk instead of dropping it — the lines surface at alt
//     exit's store rebuild. Only a client bundle predating that fix still
//     drops there, losing exactly what pre-split code lost; wire-compatible
//     both ways.
//
//     2. Bell and the ED3 scrollbackCleared flag ride the dropped screen
//     payload and are lost for the resuming client alone, when its resume
//     acquires the write lock inside the window between this frame's
//     registry.Snapshot() (buildFrame's first statement, before any row
//     renders) and this goroutine's writeMu acquisition — a full render
//     plus a full payload encode, i.e. milliseconds under a heavy drain,
//     not microseconds. The ED3 loss self-heals at the app's next ED3
//     (kiro-cli re-emits it on every resize redraw); until then that
//     client over-retains history the server dropped.
//
// A nil state is tolerated for frames constructed without a registry
// snapshot (tests); buildFrame always populates writers, so production
// frames never take the ungated path.

// (by absolute index), and leaves the next flush to repaint the window
// idempotently.

// The order of the window frame and the replay depends on the live alt

// the client drops scroll frames while that flag is set (store.ts
// applyScroll):
//   - main screen (winAlt == false): the window frame precedes the replay
//     so a client with a stale alt flag (disconnected in alt, app left alt
//     while away) leaves alt before the replayed history lands; otherwise
//     it silently drops those frames.
//   - alt screen (winAlt == true): the replay precedes the window frame so
//     a client not yet in alt (fresh load / second tab on an in-alt
//     session) stores the main-screen history before the window frame
//     flips it into alt; otherwise that history is lost.
//
// haveThrough is the highest absolute line index the client already
// holds (-1 = none). The server replays lines with index > haveThrough,
// clamped into the retained range; the resumeAck's oldestIndex lets the
// client detect an eviction gap when its haveThrough is older than what
// the ring still holds.
//
// sentBytes is the client's claimed total of reliable input bytes sent this

// reclaimed the ledger) while sentBytes > 0, the client believed it had a
// ledger the server no longer holds — the server cannot vouch for any of
// that input (it cannot distinguish forgotten-after-applying from
// lost-having-applied-nothing), so the resumeAck carries an explicit
// ledger-lost flag and the client drops-and-notifies deterministically
// instead of guessing from an ambiguous received=0.
// replayMax lets the client ask for FEWER than the maxReplayLines the replay is
// bounded to regardless (see replayStart: the bound is unconditional, because no
// ring depth makes streaming the whole ring the right answer). parseReplayMax has
