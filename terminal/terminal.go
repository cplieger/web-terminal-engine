// No external multiplexer is involved — the VT emulator IS the
// persistence layer.

// Wire protocol (binary WebSocket frames):
//
//	client → server: raw terminal input bytes
//	server → client: binary frames encoding screen/scroll/modes/title/
//	                 resumeAck/pong messages (see wire_binary.go) — PTY
//	                 output is rendered into the VT screen and sent as
//	                 absolute-indexed cell runs, not as raw bytes
//	client → server: JSON control messages prefixed with 0x00:
//	  {"type":"resize",...}, {"type":"resume",...}, {"type":"ping"}
//
// The 0x00 prefix byte distinguishes control messages from raw
// input; no valid terminal input starts with NUL.

// the live alt-screen state) and replays the lines the client is missing
// (by absolute index), and leaves the next flush to repaint the window
// idempotently.
//
// The order of the window frame and the replay depends on the live alt
// state, because the window frame is what sets the client's alt flag and
// the client drops scroll frames while that flag is set (store.ts
// applyScroll):
//   - main screen (winAlt == false): the window frame precedes the replay
//     so a client with a stale alt flag (disconnected in alt, app left alt
//     while away) leaves alt before the replayed history lands; otherwise
//     it silently drops those frames (finding l-f38).
//   - alt screen (winAlt == true): the replay precedes the window frame so
//     a client not yet in alt (fresh load / second tab on an in-alt
//     session) stores the main-screen history before the window frame
//     flips it into alt; otherwise that history is lost (the h-f1
//     regression).
//
// haveThrough is the highest absolute line index the client already
// holds (-1 = none). The server replays lines with index > haveThrough,
// clamped into the retained range; the resumeAck's oldestIndex lets the
// client detect an eviction gap when its haveThrough is older than what
// the ring still holds.
//
// sentBytes is the client's claimed total of reliable input bytes sent this
// session. When the resume key misses the registry (idle GC or cap eviction
// reclaimed the ledger) while sentBytes > 0, the client believed it had a
// ledger the server no longer holds — the server cannot vouch for any of
// that input (it cannot distinguish forgotten-after-applying from
// lost-having-applied-nothing), so the resumeAck carries an explicit
// ledger-lost flag and the client drops-and-notifies deterministically
