// layout knowledge, not the engine's). Both CROSS-side floors are EXCLUSIVE
// bounds: a revision exactly at the peer's floor is compatible, matching the
// runtime checks. The WITHIN-side floor is inclusive: a half may declare a
// floor equal to its own revision (it just refuses every older peer).
//
// Deliberately stricter than runtime on version-silent input: a

// the gate failed to read the constant and must fail loudly.
//
// Higher-than-known revisions are compatible here, as at runtime: a future
// revision alone does not prove its compatible baseline is unusable.

// peer floor may not exceed its own revision, because such a build could not
// talk to a peer of its own revision. This is a BEHAVIOUR CHANGE relative to

// individually incoherent (e.g. a client end with Rev 4 and MinPeer 5) was
// previously judged on the cross-side floors alone and could be reported
// compatible; it is now reported incompatible. No correctly extracted pair of
