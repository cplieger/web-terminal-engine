// WebSocket lifecycle with reliable input delivery across reconnects.
//
// This is the client → server half of the terminal protocol (the
// server → client half is the binary screen/scroll/modes wire format
// decoded by wire-binary.ts). It owns the socket, the reconnect
// backoff, and the resume/inputAck reliability layer.
//
// Protocol (resume / inputAck):
//   - Client maintains a resume key for the page lifetime, an `outbox` of
//     input bytes sent but not yet acknowledged, and a `bytesSent` counter.
//     Unmanaged mode: a per-tab UUID. Managed mode: `<serverSessionId>#<per-
//     client instance id>`, so every device/tab attached to one session owns
//     its OWN server-side input ledger (see resumeKey — shared ledgers acked
//     other devices' bytes to this one and corrupted its outbox).
//   - On WS open, client sends control: {type:"resume", sessionId, sentBytes}.
//   - Server replies with {type:"resumeAck", received:M}; subsequent
//     screen/scroll messages also carry inputAck = bytesReceived. Client
//     trims the outbox by acked count and retransmits the remainder.
//   - This handles the network-blip failure mode where ws.send() reports
//     success but TCP couldn't deliver before the connection broke.
//
// Outbox is bounded at MAX_OUTBOX_BYTES; once full, sendBinary refuses
// new input and surfaces the failure via onOutboxFull. This prevents
// holding-down a key during a long disconnect from growing the outbox
// without bound.
