// The mouse module's two DOM-contract obligations, which no behavioural test can
// see: the wheel listener's passive flag and the disposer's detach. Neither is
// observable from the outcome of a dispatched event — a passive listener's
// preventDefault is ignored with only a console warning, and a leaked listener
// looks identical until something else is listening too.
//
// Both are asserted at the registration, and both are stated that way on
// purpose. `passive: false` is what makes the unconditional preventDefault in
// the wheel handler legal — a passive listener's preventDefault is ignored with a
// console warning, and the page scrolls behind the terminal, which is the exact
// regression the handler's own comment says it exists to prevent (xterm.js does
// the same: swallow the gesture even when there is nothing to report). And
// `detach` is the disposer's stated contract: the module-level `handler = null`
// already stops every report, so a dropped detach leaves four listeners on an
// element the consumer believes it has released, with no report anywhere to show
// it.
