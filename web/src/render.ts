// Render layer: store-backed, absolute-index DOM rows.
//
// The renderer owns a LineStore (the authoritative client model) and reflects
// it to the DOM. Every terminal line is a `div.term-row` carrying a `data-abs`
// attribute equal to its absolute index; the rows sit in one natively-scrolled
// container in absolute order. There is no separate "live zone" and
// "scrollback": the live window is simply the last `height` absolute indices,
// and a line that scrolls into history just stops being updated. This is what
// removes the live/history reconciliation that caused the duplicate-rows and
// view-jumping bugs.
//
// Decode frames feed the store (handleScreen/handleScroll); a single
// requestAnimationFrame flush drains the store's change set and applies it:
// evicted indices drop their row, dirty indices build/update their row in
// place. The window block always has `height` rows, so scrollHeight only grows
// when real history commits — never oscillating mid-redraw.

 *
 * Measured on a 4769-row tab in Chromium: after the wipe the scroller had ZERO
 * rows of content and an 81081px scroll range, held by the caret and the
 * textarea still sitting at 81064px, with the viewport parked at 80281px over
 * nothing. Two consequences, and the second is why this is not cosmetic:
 *
 *   - The reader sees that empty region, which paints the terminal's background:
 *     a black pane, and then a partial row clipped to the top edge once the
 *     drain's growing block reaches the parked offset.
 *   - `stickToBottom` is DISARMED. It measures `distanceFromBottom()` against
 *     the phantom height, reads 0 — already at the bottom — and pins nothing, so
 *     the invariant that would otherwise rescue the view refuses to act for
 *     exactly as long as the phantom height survives.
 *
 * The renderer heals all four at the END of the first flush
 * (`positionCursorOverlay` plus `onCursorMove`), so the window is normally one
 * frame and invisible. It stops being one frame whenever that tail does not
 * run on time: a long frame (the wipe tears down thousands of rows), a throw
 * mid-drain (the catch skips the tail and the bounded give-up can stop
 * rescheduling), or a full reset arriving with the switch's reconnect. The
 * reported symptom is a scroll tick clearing it, which fits: a scroll re-enters
 * the built block, and the block sits at the TOP of the phantom range.
 *
 * Collapsing here also makes the wipe's clamp SYNCHRONOUS, which two callers
 * need. `noteContentShrink` arms only when it observes the position actually
 * move, so a deferred clamp left the wipe — the largest shrink this module
 * performs — with nothing to announce. And `bind` records
 * `pendingRestore.lastWrote` from the same offset, so a deferred clamp
 * (measured: 80281 -> 4346) then read as a 76000px foreign write and threw away
 * the reading position the switch was restoring.

 *
 * Three refusals, and each one is load-bearing rather than defensive:
 *
 * **An empty queue.** `flushRender` runs `applyPendingRestore`,
 * `restoreReadAnchor` and `stickToBottomIfFollowing` unconditionally; only the
 * drain is queue-gated. So a flush scheduled from a scroll handler would run the
 * position invariants at moments the renderer never previously flushed at, and
 * because `atBottom` tolerates `BOTTOM_TOLERANCE_PX` while `stickToBottom` pins
 * on any non-zero gap, a downward scroll landing just short of the tail on an
 * IDLE session would snap to the bottom one frame later. It would also expire an
 * armed view restore early through `RESTORE_OWN_WRITE_EPSILON_PX`.
 *
 * **Alt screen.** Alt is a NAMED suspension of the drain (see the reschedule rule
 * below), and a resumption path that ignores it is not a resumption path. The
 * drain would survive anyway, because `flushRenderInner`'s alt branch returns
 * before the drain, but the flush around it would still call `renderAlt` (which
 * replaces the whole output subtree, destroying an in-alt selection) and run all
 * three position invariants. Leaning on the body of a function to make a
 * scheduling decision safe is how the next edit to that body becomes a bug. Alt
 * exit re-queues everything through `queueRowsViewportFirst`, so refusing costs
 * nothing.
 *
 * **A give-up already retried.** The catch's give-up exists so a deterministically
 * throwing row cannot become a 60fps loop. Retrying it from a scroll event would
 * move that loop outside the module rather than remove it: a flick is one scroll
 * event per frame, and `scroll.ts`'s position callback fires for the browser's own
 * clamps too, so a stuck row would log two errors per frame for the length of a
 * gesture. One retry per give-up is enough to serve the case this function exists
 * for (the reader scrolls, the surface completes) without reopening the loop the
 * cap closed. The retry is re-earned by anything that clears the streak: real
 * forward progress, an empty queue, a rebuild, or a re-attach. NOT by the give-up
 * log — a retry that throws gives up again, and re-arming there would restore the
 * per-gesture loop one indirection further out.
 *
 * Residual, accepted: `scroll.ts` fires its position seam before its own
 * announced-shrink early return, so a programmatic clamp (a cap eviction) can spend
 * the retry with no user action. The exposure is small because any successful flush
 * re-arms it, and the alternative (a time bound) adds a clock to a path whose whole

//                             main-buffer rows into the alt grid; the alt-exit
