   *

   * Three ordinary events deliver content far above the floor and leave nothing

   * attach then asked for a maximal replay forever, and `snapshot()` persisted the
   * wedge across reloads — strictly worse than the defect the floor exists to fix.
   *
   * So a range arriving entirely above `oldest` while the floor sits BELOW
   * `oldest` heals it: nothing at or above the floor is held any more, so there is
   * nothing left to protect, and holding the claim down protects only rows that no
   * longer exist. This is safe in the one direction that matters — it never raises
   * the floor over a row the store still holds provisionally, because such a row
   * would be at or above `oldest` by definition.

   * ring has moved past the client's `haveThrough`. Scoping detection to the
   * clamp alone would miss the shape that already ships.
   *
   * The band deliberately includes the OLD window rows and RETIRES the window
   * descriptor, because the batch's own window frame re-establishes it at the
   * new base — those rows stop being window rows the moment it lands.
   *
   * The band top is `sentHaveThrough` and deliberately does NOT follow the wire
   * value down now that `replayBoundary()` supplies it. The two questions are
   * different: the wire value asks "what will I not ask for", the band asks "what
   * did I claim to hold before the server answered". Rows above the sent value
   * arrived from the server as committed content, so they are real history and
   * must not be reclassified as disposable cache; rows this store holds only
   * provisionally sit at or above the boundary and are covered by the replay,
   * which now starts at `boundary + 1` precisely because of it.
   *
   * One residual, deliberately not addressed here. When the replay start is
   * CLAMPED above the boundary (`committed - replayMax`, reachable when a
   * background tab printed more than roughly `tailCap` lines), the provisional
   * rows are neither replayed nor banded, so they stay tail-classified and lose
   * the browse budget's TTL sweep. Widening the band to cover them would change a
   * pinned invariant that two existing cases assert, so it is recorded in
   * docs/resume-watermark.md rather than changed in passing.
   *
   * The retirement leaves the same transition's later steps reading a window of
   * height 0, so state precisely what that costs rather than forbidding it: the
   * only window-derived bound they touch is `enforceCap`'s, which loses the live
   * screen's eviction protection for that one pass. It is harmless HERE and not
   * by luck — after the jump the tail holds only the keys above
   * `sentHaveThrough`, so `tailCount` is far below the bound and the pass returns
   * at its first gate; and were it to run, the walk is oldest-first while the
