 *
 * This is the container `makeClampingScrollEl` cannot express, and the reason
 * this file exists a second time. Both older fixtures reconcile synchronously
 * (`setScrollHeight` re-clamps and fires the event in one call, and
 * `installRowGeometry` clamps inside the `scrollTop` GETTER), so
 * `distanceFromBottom()` is never negative in a test written on them, and the
 * whole third arithmetic state that `reconcileScrollRange` exists for is
 * unreachable. That is why the defect shipped: not one test could fail for it.
 *
 * Which of the two doubles is honest depends on the engine, and nothing in the
 * specs picks a winner. CSSOM View clamps a programmatic scroll at write time,
 * which both fixtures model; neither it nor CSS Overflow 3 says when a UA must
 * reconcile an offset the content has shrunk out from under. So a library that
 * only works on the reconciling double works only on some browsers, and every
 * position invariant deserves a test against both.
 *
 * Deliberately models ONE divergence. Writes still clamp here, because that part
 * IS specified; a fixture that broke both at once would stop being evidence
 * about either.
