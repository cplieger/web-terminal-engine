// Vitest configuration for @cplieger/web-terminal-engine unit tests.
//
// Two projects, and the DEFAULT is the browser. A test file runs in a real
// headless Chromium unless its name opts out, because the browser is the
// environment this package actually ships into: it renders DOM, measures text
// through a real Canvas2D, and reads real layout.
//
// The opt-out is the `.node.test.ts` suffix, and it is load-bearing rather than
// decorative — placement has to be readable off the filename, because one of
// the two reasons a file needs Node fails SILENTLY when it is misplaced. Here
// all three node files need genuine Node CAPABILITIES: they read golden
// fixtures from ../../wire-golden/ by name, and wire-manifest WRITES a
// regenerated manifest back into the repo under UPDATE_GOLDEN=1. A write has no
// Vite-import equivalent at all, so it is the irreducible case.
//
// The reason lives in the stem (`wire-golden`, `wire-compatibility`,
// `wire-manifest`) and the placement in the suffix (`.node`). Fuzz keeps its own
// axis: `*.fuzz.test.ts` is how ts-ci selects fuzz targets, and a DOM fuzz test
// (hyperlink-safety) needs no marker here at all.
//
// `extends: true` on both projects is REQUIRED, not decorative: a project
// inherits NOTHING from the root `test` block without it, so the root's
// `expect.requireAssertions`, `allowOnly`, `mockReset`, `clearMocks`,
// `restoreMocks`, `unstubGlobals`, `sequence` and timeouts would be silently
// dropped — and losing a strictness option never fails a test, so the suite
// would stay green while the guarantees went away.
//
// `channel: "chromium"` opts into Chromium's newer headless mode, the real
// browser rather than the separate headless-shell build. CI installs it with
// `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`; locally it is a one-time
// `npx --no-install playwright install chromium`.
//
// web/e2e/** stays outside every include here: it is Playwright's namespace
// (playwright.config.ts testDir "./e2e"), it spawns server child processes, and
// it is run by `npm run test:e2e`. Both projects therefore glob under src/.
//
// Run: vitest --run (single pass) or vitest (watch mode).
